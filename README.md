# HelpMeow Mobile Development Project
This Mobile Development repository belongs to **C23-PS349 Team** Capstone Project for Bangkit Academy 2023

**Machine Learning:**

**Cloud:**

**Project Background:**

Nearly 250 million stray cats roam Indonesia's streets, suffering from malnutrition, illness, and a lack of proper shelter (source: jakartaglobe.id). Also, there are 67% of the 10,442 respondents in Indonesia had pets. But, still can't tell the difference between the breeds of cats. Based on that problems, we propose a solution called HelpMeow, a community app committed to improving the lives of lost/stray cats and building a caring community of cat lovers.

**Android Role:**
HelpMeow is used three roles to interact: Seeker, Gifter, and Watcher. Seekers obtain information, Gifters provide information about stray or for-sale cats, and Watchers have access to both options. HelpMeow utilizes image detection through Machine Learning to determine the breed of cats and provides an information page of each breed. User input image will be sent to cloud (and the result will be returned by Retrofit). The platform has a social media-like appearance and includes an indicator for whether a stray/lost cat has been rescued or not.

Through these features, HelpMeow fosters a community of cat lovers and provides a comprehensive platform for supporting and caring for stray/lost cats. The project's research question focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of the application in providing accurate and useful information.
